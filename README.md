#### Project to discover *LUA* language and modding on AOE4.
##### The code structure is inspired from AGS mod.

### Historical background

This mod refers to the siege of Caffa in the 14th century, where the Mongols, whose army decimated by the Black Death during the siege of Caffa, decided to send plague-ridden corpses by trebuchet above the city walls. Which caused the inhabitants of the city to flee the city to avoid the disease. This event is considered to be the trigger for the second plague epidemic in Europe.

### Purpose of the mod

This mod offers players to join forces with each other to fight against the bacteria.  

Victims of the Black Plague, a number of villagers that increments with each wave, become infected in a player's randomly selected base. If you fail to help each other to fight the disease, then it will spread enough to destroy your cities and kill your people. The infected have modified attributes. More precisely, increased damage and increased walking speed... Perhaps more in the future ? Bacteria mutate quickly! So be reactive and above all, take up arms!
